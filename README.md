## A central repository, with links to all LWF community developed tools.

Community developed tools are very important for LWF and we want to support talented developers from all coding backgrounds. 

The time and effort each community developer invests into creating something awesome for LWF is invaluable.

We all know it’s hard to keep track of the links to 100’s of really useful code repositories, trying to find the right tool quickly can be frustrating.  So we have developed this repository with the aim of creating a centralised list of tools, containing links to the specific tool repository.  

One of the benefits of this setup is that LWF doesn’t host a fork of the repository, but only needs to maintain a link to the users own repository.

## Adding a Repo

Users can submit their dpos tool links by logging an [issue](https://github.com/lwfcoin/LWF-Tommunity-Tools/issues/new/choose), make sure you first login.

## When will the Repo's be added

Tools will be updated each week. Every month, new tools will be included in a monthly bounty programme (details to be provided in due course). Bounties will be awarded based on impact of the pull requests, Issues logged, bugs found, new tools, upgrades to existing tools, api wrappers and documentation updates.
